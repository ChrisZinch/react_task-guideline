# React tasks guideline

## Workflow
- Fork the repository with task
- Clone forked repository
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Then develop inside `src/` folder

## Development mode
- Run `npm start` to start development server on `http://localhost:3000`
  When you run server the command line window will no longer be available for
  writing commands until you stop server (`ctrl + c`). All other commands you
  need to run in new command line window.
- Follow [HTML, CSS styleguide](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/htmlcss.html)
- Follow [the simplified JS styleguide](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/javascript-standard-modified)
- run `npm run lint` to check code style and fix all the errors
- When you finished add correct `homepage` to `package.json` and run `npm run deploy`
- Commit and push all recent changes.
- run `npm run deploy` to publish your solution on Github pages
- Create `Pull Request` (`PR`) from forked repo `(<branch_name>)` to the original repo
(`master`) 
- add correct `[DEMO LINK]` to the `PR` description
- Add the `PR` link to the Google Spreadsheets for code review and put `r` next to your link.
